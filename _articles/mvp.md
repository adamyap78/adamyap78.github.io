# An Insightful New Take on Minimum Viable Product

Actually, this isn't an insightful new take on MVP.

It's actually a link to <a href="https://leanstartup.co/resources/articles/what-is-an-mvp/">What is an MVP</a>, by Eric Ries, the author of The Lean Startup.

If you don't know what an MVP is, stop reading this - and read Eric's article. It's the OG. It takes 15 minutes to read and understand. There's a video.

If you don't have the time to read and understand this, you don't have the time to build an MVP.

While you're at it, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Lean-Startup-Eric-Ries/dp/0307887898">The Lean Startup</a>. Building a startup in Perth but can't afford a copy? Get in touch, and I'll give you one.
