# An Insightful New Take on Minimum Viable Product

Actually, this isn't an insightful new take on MVP.

It's actually a link to <a href="https://leanstartup.co/resources/articles/what-is-an-mvp/">What is an MVP</a>, by Eric Ries, the author of The Lean Startup.

If you don't know what an MVP is, stop reading this - and read Eric's article. It's the OG. It takes 15 minutes to read and understand. There's a video.

If you don't have the time to read and understand this, you don't have the time to build an MVP.

While you're at it, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses/dp/0670921602/ref=sr_1_3?crid=37N3P10N38115&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6tD306tQX7WJWdAWBf5yVYTeCUF5nBBSopnt1NodWVvHazhhKFds33zU_hS8aM-lGR-K13YTpzvttl3eUofzVuU3ZVw_3dnRop5oHrzTNL3mylhxOg9A8dJiSHRvZoPVqqsnM4gU6ClrbDil021tfH3yc6-eAyf5NPajzkJvEV76ArHgitl_azk5LSAz4-O3nUAGNjPq8g1YZptmVcft0TMVp3TwSQaU2toNeOI1cRk.YGeokrpKJ_Nncf4DKiYwugouwlSPwVrOK47-NAqLumY&dib_tag=se&keywords=lean+startup&qid=1761964683&s=books&sprefix=lean+start%2Cstripbooks%2C277&sr=1-3">The Lean Startup</a>.
