I'm a founder (Healthengine, GPsite, ADP, Caloriestory, Neospace)  who loves helping founders. 

I love the messy, chaotic, stressful, rewarding, intense and  profound experience of being a startup tech founder. I love working with smart people on interesting problems. Adding disproportionate value is very rewarding. Helping people makes me happy. So does winning. 

I usually end up working in these areas:

- Product, Willingness to Pay and MVP
- Pricing and Go-To-Market Strategy for digital startups
- AI and Online Tech
- Raising money for startups
- Founder mindset and wellness

FWIW I have degrees in Law, Accounting and Finance. I've been coding since I was 6.

I live in Perth, Western Australia.

I'm always happy to meet founders in person. If you're a Perth-based digital founder, <a href="mailto:hello@adamyap.com">drop me a line</a> if you want to talk about your startup.

## Recommended Reading

I often get asked, "what books or articles do you recommend?". This is the shortlist. I don't agree with everything in all of these, but I have found great value in all of them.
